## I created a model for Iris Flower Classification using machine learning with a dataset from Kaggle. The data set consists of samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.

## Steps in doing this project:
- Importing libraries and dataset
- Understanding the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modelling
- Choosing the best-performing model
- Saving the model
- Using Flask for deployment
