# Iris Flower Classification Project with Deployment 
![iris-machinelearning](https://github.com/mrpaul017/Iris_Flower_Classification_Project/assets/145193843/26c0d0db-5841-42e2-86ca-dcbda54e1afe)

I created a model for Iris Flower Classification using machine learning using a dataset from Kaggle. The data set consists of samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Steps in doing this project:
- Importing libraries and dataset
- Understanding the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modelling
- Choosing the best-performing model
- Saving the model
- Using Flask for deployment
